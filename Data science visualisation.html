                        This grouped bar chart compares Government R&D expenditure across the top 10 economic sectors over three years (2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21). 
                        Government R&D funding is highly concentrated, with about 75% of the budget going to two primary sectors: Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities and Agriculture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Key trends from 2018-2021 show:

                    <ul>
                        <li>An overall decline in total R&D spending by 5.3%.</li>
                        <li>A significant reduction in funding for the manufacturing sector.</li>
                        <li>Resilient and prioritized investment in science, technology, and agriculture.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In essence, the data reveals a strategic government policy that favors the knowledge-based economy and food security over industrial innovation.

                    <p>
                        This scatter plot visualizes the gender distribution in senior secondary education across all Indian states. 
                        The diagonal line represents equal enrollment, with points above indicating more girls than boys and below indicating the opposite. 
                        The color gradient represents total Class XII enrollment levels by state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The analysis reveals a significant regional divide in gender parity for senior secondary (Class XII) enrollment across India.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Key findings include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Northern India Challenge:</strong> Large northern states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan show a strong male bias, with more boys enrolled than girls. Uttar Pradesh has the highest total enrollment but also one of the most significant gender gaps.</li>
                        <li><strong>Southern & Northeastern Success:</strong> In contrast, southern states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala, along with most northeastern states, demonstrate better gender parity, often enrolling more girls than boys.</li>
                        <li><strong>National Picture:</strong> Nationally, boys slightly outnumber girls, a trend heavily skewed by the large, male-dominated northern states. Smaller states often show a more equitable balance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Core Implication:</strong> While India has improved gender parity at the primary level, significant cultural and traditional barriers prevent girls from reaching senior secondary education in certain key regions, highlighting a need for targeted policy changes.

                    <div class="viz-image">
                        <img src="Boxplot.png" alt="PM2.5 Pollution Levels Box Plot" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">

                    <p>
                        This box plot displays PM2.5 air pollution concentration levels across India's top 10 cities, ordered by average PM2.5 concentration. 
                        The visualization shows the distribution, median values, and outliers for each city, with Bhiwadi and Delhi showing the highest pollution levels. 
                        Each box represents the interquartile range, with sample sizes (n) indicated above each plot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The analysis reveals a widespread public health crisis across India's top 10 polluted cities, with PM2.5 levels in all locations dramatically exceeding World Health Organization (WHO) safety guidelines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Key insights from the box plots include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Top Polluters:</strong> Bhiwadi ranks as the most polluted city, followed by Ghaziabad, Delhi, and the Noida region, which consistently record the highest average PM2.5 levels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extreme Health Risk:</strong> Pollution concentrations in these cities are severe, ranging from 4.5 to 13 times higher than the WHO's recommended limit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Different Pollution Patterns:</strong> The data shows varied pollution behavior. Bhiwadi exhibits the highest variability, with extreme day-to-day fluctuations. In contrast, cities like Ghaziabad show more consistent and stable (though still dangerously high) pollution levels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pollution Spikes:</strong> The presence of outliers in the data for multiple cities indicates that they suffer from occasional, extreme pollution episodes that are even worse than their typical high averages.</li>
                    </ul>
